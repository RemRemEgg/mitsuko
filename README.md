# mitsuko
*This is in very early development*


Mitsuko is a compiler for Minecraft Commands from a custom language.
The input language is inspired by JavaScript, but modified to be able to fit into a data pack easily. 
I'm not good at writing compilers, so the code is a bit slow and restrictive (and it would put an italian restaurant to shame).

This is mainly an exercise for me to practice Rust, but I'm also trying to make sure that it can be a decent, working program.
Feel free to open a ticket with any ideas you have for features once I get an actual release out.

*Note: I'm kinda busy, so it could be awhile before the first working prototype is out ;)
Eventually, I'll have a reference for the language*
