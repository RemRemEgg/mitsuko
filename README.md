# mitsuko
*This is in very early development*


Mitsuko is a compiler for Minecraft Commands from a custom language.
The input language is inspired by JavaScript, but modified to be able to fit into a datapack easily. 
I'm not good at writing compilers, so the code is a bit slow and restrictive (and it would put an italian resturant to shame).

This is mainly an exersize for me to pratice Rust, but I'm also trying to make sure that it can be a decent, working program.
Feel free to open a ticket with any ideas you have for features once I get an actual release out.

*Note: Im kinda busy, so it could be a while before the first working prototype is out ;)
Eventually, Ill have a reference for the language*
